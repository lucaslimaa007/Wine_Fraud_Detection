## Overview
Wine fraud encompasses the business aspects of the wine industry. The primary form of fraud involves the adulteration of wines, typically by adding lower-cost substances such as juices, occasionally accompanied by potentially harmful chemicals and sweeteners, which aim to compensate for color or flavor deficiencies.

Additionally, counterfeiting and the act of relabeling inferior and cheaper wines to pass them off as higher-priced brands are frequent occurrences in wine fraud.

## Project Goals
The primary objective is to utilize the wine dataset presented below in order to construct a machine learning model that endeavors to forecast whether a wine is categorized as "Legit" or "Fraudulent" using a range of chemical characteristics.
